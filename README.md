# Data_encryption_standard

Cryptography/DES Implementation:
 In the field of cryptography when there was an early stage DES (Data Encryption Standard) was introduced to encrypt and decrypt any
message, files or any kind of information.
 This was symmetric key algorithm (Only one key for both encryption and decryption purposes). I have implemented this Algorithm
using C++ for encoding binary message (if a message is in ASCII characters we will first convert it to binary and then will encrypt) using
DES with using a 64-bit key.
